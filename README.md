# Zen Youtube

The idea of this is to have a Youtube search page without the annoying related videos. Unfortunately, Youtube recently started putting very strict quotas on its search APIs, so this will start to hit errors after a bit and stop working.

### Key features:

- React / React-DOM (using only functional components + Hooks)
- Redux (leveraging new Redux hooks)
- Webpack
- Babel
- node-sass
- Typescript

## Getting started

Using node v12.16.2 (npm v6.14.4), type `npm install`.

To run dev server type `npm start`.

The server runs on localhost:3000.
